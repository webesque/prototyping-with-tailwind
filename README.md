Pre-configured project to run browser-sync and tailwindcss together for
quicker feedback when prototyping a design.

**Experimental.** Because this project is configured to run using the [tailwindcss just in time compiler][0],
it should be considered experimental, just like this new tailwindcss feature.

Quick start

```shell
npm ci && npm start
```
